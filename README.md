Group Extraction, Secret Santa Assignment

Extracts group names from an Excel file and counts their occurrences. It reads the "Additional comments" column, extracts group names using regular expressions (regex), and saved the results in a CSV file.

Automates the Secret Santa gift exchange by randomly assigning a gift giver to a recipient while ensuring no one gifts themselves.
